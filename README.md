# 🎓 Smart Attendance Tracking System

A **Design Thinking-based project** that modernizes classroom attendance using **AI-powered facial recognition** to eliminate manual processes, prevent proxy attendance, and streamline academic data tracking.

---

## 🧠 Design Thinking Process

### 1. **Empathize**
- Surveys & interviews conducted with faculty and students (40+ responses)
- Identified pain points: time waste, proxy attendance, data inconsistency

### 2. **Define**
- Primary Need: Fast, fraud-proof attendance tracking
- Secondary Needs: Notifications, real-time dashboards, app support
- Latent Needs: AI anomaly detection, emotional/stress tracking

### 3. **Ideate**
- Brainstormed via Mind Mapping & 5-Why Analysis
- Explored technologies: Facial recognition, QR codes, sensors
- Evaluated RFID and fingerprint systems (rejected for hygiene, cost)

### 4. **Prototype**
- Software-only solution using laptop camera
- AI-based facial recognition with secure, real-time data sync
- UI tested with simulated student database
